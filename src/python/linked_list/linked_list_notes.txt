General gotchas
    General notes
        Can be implemented as a node with a head
        Probably needs wrapper, because if multiple objects need a reference to it, the head can still change
    Questions:
        O complexity
    O:
       No index, so finding stuff is slower than with an array
       Add or remove elements from the beginning or the end in constant time
    Create a Node class with data and next
    Create LinkedList with head
    In Python:
        Iterate with for loop from self, otherwise reassign fails
        Create __iter__ with generator
    Normal iteration (find): while node, node = node.next
    Append: while node.next, node = node.next
    Remove duplicates:
        Simple solution: keep track of the duplicates in a set, and have a previous node so that you can reassign its .next property. The trick is that you add every element not in the duplicates set, until something is in it, then reassign previous.next = node.next
        Gotcha: you need to remove only the duplicates, so the original remains
        O(N), 1 space complexity
    Remove duplicates 2:
        O(N ^ 2)
    Delete node:
        Ask: does it need to return, does it need exception when empty?
        Ask: API?
        Ask: error handling?
        Raise exception on empty head
        Otherwise:
            Check head
                If not in head: save head as previous node, head as node, then iterate and reassign: prev_node = node, node = node.next
                Or in Java: while node.next, node.next.next
